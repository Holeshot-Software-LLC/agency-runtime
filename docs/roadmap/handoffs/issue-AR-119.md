# AR-119 active recovery capsule

Load this file and the founding vision first, then the newest loop-status section.
This is a recovery map, not evidence that an unproven matrix cell moved.

## checkpoint

- Branch `codex/ar278-openclaw-one-pass` is based on clean failure-evidence ledger checkpoint `01a8ad24`; `origin/main` is `4a326773`, `f76050d7` is an ancestor, and Agency 0.1.0 imports from this checkout.
- OpenClaw remains audited 2026.7.1-2 on native `litellm/task-general` plus six unchanged fallbacks. Agency alone uses `linux-task-agency-router`, provider type `litellm`, and exact alias/model-group `task-agency-router`; no protected-host route changed.
- Final Agency-only repair `d7187e80` installed as `fa68e6a4...`, runtime `573a6a14...`, launcher `d65af026...`; native routes/hashes stayed unchanged and RPC, 12 hooks, and both channels were green.
- Fresh session `6360c186...` passed exact status (`86f838f0...` / `ad834646...` / `a67e66ad...` / `d84fc7d8...`) and Telegram delivered `agency-steward / none / none / requested execution alias task-general / deterministic`.
- `node-connect` run `25fa081a...`, trace `c1bbbdc7...`, routing `3548700e...`, specialist `8e538079...`, skill `d02c71ae...`, and terminal `6907ed38...` delivered the exact inference header. Three applied receipts prove automatic OpenClaw/LiteLLM profile and exact `task-agency-router` alias/group with zero fallback.
- Substantive run `72314429...`, trace `50c11095...`, routing `21b8b545...`, specialists `4bb8ce63...` / `1707c674...`, and terminal `803465de...` delivered the exact inference header. Three applied plus one contract-invalid attempt stayed on the same profile; zero cross-provider fallback, no child/delegation, actual model unavailable, transcript `93dcbc...`.
- Store backup `02a76504...` is `ok`, schema 47, contractors 15. OpenClaw host-scoped acceptance passes; Rule 4/delegation is unproven and the matrix is unchanged.
- Hermes v0.20.4 parent acceptance remains retained: Agency-only install `0a3d141a...`, bundle `45b76c0e...`, launcher `e65a0784...`, exact status/skill/substantive Telegram delivery, and Agency LiteLLM receipts on `linux-task-agency-router` / `task-agency-router` with zero cross-provider fallback. Final backup `bdf1a6e6...` is `ok`/`ok`, schema 47, contractors 15; actual upstream model is unavailable.
- The first OpenClaw native-child draw is preserved as a failure: a real `sessions_spawn` child completed its read-only work, but the completion entered a synthetic `announce:v1:...` run and Agency suppressed its targeted send before Telegram queueing. Staffing still used the unprojected timeout and terminal correlation depended on process memory; execution alone does not prove delivery.
- AR-280/AR-281 now project the OpenClaw host-profile timeout, reconcile lifecycle durably, and prepare/finalize completion against the exact parent trace. Only one exact, implicit-target, one-use `message(action=send)` can carry the finalized parent header/body; no synthetic completion run or inference receipt is created. Orphan and ambiguous completion identities fail closed before ordinary preflight, while Hermes retains its prior timeout. The focused gate passes 299 tests with 1 existing skip.
- This repair is pre-live: Agency has not been reinstalled into OpenClaw and no changed Telegram child proof exists. Hermes remains the untouched break-glass host; Codex OAuth/config/canary, Claude, and ZCode remain untouched.

## completed-evidence

- OpenClaw reset, activation, exact status, changed skill, substantive Agency inference, first-pass headers, Store correlation, and Telegram delivery all pass on the installed repair.
- `task-agency-router` remains confined to Agency workforce inference; OpenClaw's native parent stays `task-general`. No Codex, Claude, ZCode, or Hermes route changed.
- Install provenance, config invariants, credential-name presence, contractor preservation, final Store integrity, and zero fallback are retained.
- Earlier failures remain retained. Operational child delivery and strict ADR-0156 Rule 4 proof are both unproven; no matrix cell moved.
- Hermes reinstall, exact status, corrected attribution, skill, substantive routing, Store correlation, headers, and Telegram delivery pass.

## exact-blocker

OpenClaw's Agency-only completion repair is locally green but not installed or live-proven. Strict Rule 4 remains unproven because neither host supplies an ADR-0156 artifact receipt.

## traps (machine-specific; do not rediscover)

- Shell umask is `0002`; security-sensitive tests need process-local `0077`.
- OpenClaw service is `openclaw-gateway.service`; effective Hermes home is `/home/holeshot/.hermes-nexus`.
- Hermes service is `hermes-gateway-nexus.service`; its plugin parent was safely tightened from `0775` to `0700` after the installer correctly refused the shared-write boundary.
- Never emit credential values or numeric channel/user identifiers. The Store channel session key is retained only by SHA.
- OpenClaw `model_call_ended` proves requested metadata, not the LiteLLM answering model. Never promote an alias into an actual-model claim.
- Do not run unsupported host canaries or reconfigure/re-prove Codex.

## next-bounded-work-package

1. Create the clean implementation/ledger checkpoint.
2. Reinstall Agency Runtime only into OpenClaw and prove one changed native-child turn over Telegram.
3. Touch Hermes only after OpenClaw passes; never promote operational return evidence into Rule 4.

## same-task-continuity

Continue in this task after the checkpoint. Preserve every failed receipt and do not retry unchanged code/state.

## constraints

- Local host/config/store/install/restart/smoke and local commit authority is current. Push, PR, tracker mutation, and hosted Actions are forbidden.
- Do not weaken executable trust, final-only delivery, Store correlation, inference evidence, or child-delivery checks.
- No Codex OAuth/configuration change or Codex canary belongs in this package.
