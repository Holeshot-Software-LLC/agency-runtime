# AR-404 oldest-first backlog completion handoff

## Checkpoint

Owner resumed September 6: oldest first, one record/PR/merge, then next; no
routine approval stops. Windows stays with the owner. AR-131 is done and PR
#698 merged at ac1ce173 (September 7, 04:12:09Z); local main is clean. The merge
ledger is e21e8da4 in the next owned AR-135 branch.

Current package: retain AR-135 with its implemented contracts and exact
remaining attended native-proof obligation. No production code change;
only a misleading test docstring/comment is corrected. Publish this disposition
before moving to AR-138; AR-136 and AR-137 are already done.

## Completed evidence

- Exact earlier sequential dispositions are in the oldest-first ledger:
  AR-115/127 retired; AR-119/120/125/129/130 retained with genuine gaps.
- AR-131 original MCP repairs were present. Its first isolated review exposed
  public identifier aliasing; first verdicts are preserved at 6a139e23.
  Repair 973acdb9 rejects lossy public IDs before Store writes while preserving
  internal native normalization. All six original criteria independently pass.
- AR-131: 13 new public-entry cases pass; MCP/CLI 126/five existing skips;
  named spine 1085/three skips (68.60s); UI 138; routing/Ruff pass; conformance
  184/184 protected mutations killed, zero survived/invalid, source unchanged.
  Broader 380-pass/one-failure/eight-skip run is not green: the unchanged
  fallback-roster fixture also fails on prior main and belongs to AR-176.
- Current count: 40 actual open trackers plus 98 unfinished legacy records,
  138 local unfinished. AR-135 retention changes no count. No duplicate tracker.
- AR-135 source: independent ZCode renderer/config registration, exact seven
  hooks, idempotency, preservation, toggle/rollback/drift and host identity exist.
  Current tests: 16 installer/header (4.74s), 13 selected hook/Stop (5.80s),
  four child-adapter/delivery/profile cases (0.31s), all pass.
- Current-source generated ZCode smoke: 4/4 pass, no skips. It proves Store,
  roster, five-host parity and isolated ZCode config/process contracts:
  preservation, idempotency, per-handler toggles and SessionStart execution.
  It does not launch the native ZCode app, parent/child or full Stop lifecycle.
- Read-only ZCode inspection: discovered/staged/registered/enabled true, loaded
  unknown, no canary/attestation, enabled-runtime-unverified. Executable null;
  command lookup also finds no zcode CLI. August 19 record-zero evidence stays
  historical, not current-package certification.

## Exact blocker

AR-135 native proof is waiting_for_operator: one attended installed ZCode Agent
success/failure and full parent Stop capture. Do not invent a headless backend
or promote a stubbed hook test into native proof. This does not block the next
independent backlog disposition.

AR-176 owns six stale fixture cases found in AR-127/130/131. Ordinary-session
unverified Agency staffing/header remains a separate unfinished concern.
AR-119/125 retain the wider five-host/value evidence; no matrix cell is waived.

## Same-task continuity

Use one owned worktree/branch per item; never commit directly to main.
Substantive commit then immediate narrow docs(worklog) ledger. Record the prior
merge in the next worktree. Preserve unrelated staged work in other trees.
At 50-percent context, ensure a clean evidence/ledger checkpoint and continue
the same task; do not spawn a replacement task or close an unfinished umbrella.

## Next bounded work package

1. Finish AR-135's record/test-wording disposition, focused checks and exact
   substantive/ledger pair. Its five original criteria and open status remain.
2. Open one PR, verify its final head/check state and merge normally. Record the
   attended proof plan; do not require the owner to answer before continuing.
3. Review AR-138 next. Native Windows execution remains excluded.
4. AR-135 later: pin the exact installed package and existing profile in an
   attended session; capture Agent success/failure, one-use identities,
   record-zero prompt delivery and complete Stop input/output. Then freeze
   evidence per original criterion and obtain isolated acceptance.

## Verification

Run metadata, policy availability, exact worklog, strict docs/tracker and diff
checks per package, with focused checks for touched behavior. AR-135 changes
no executable production behavior; the current AR-131 named-spine/UI/routing/
conformance receipts above retain their exact scope. No new exhaustive corpus,
coverage/interpreter matrix, hosted dispatch or release/installed-live proof.
The graphify graph is absent; bounded source inspection was used, with no
graph build, specialist selection or native subagent staffing.

## Constraints

No credential creation, human-trust bypass, unmanaged gateway restart or provider
policy change. A single runtime-requested Codex refresh returned exit 1 with
registered files but activation required, trust unverified and mixed installed
projections. Do not retry or replace OpenClaw as part of backlog record cleanup.
Generated smoke and staged files do not establish normal-session activation.
