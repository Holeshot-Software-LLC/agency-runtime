# AR-297 active recovery capsule

## checkpoint

- Work remains in dedicated worktree `/tmp/agency-runtime-ar297.WQUbF2` on
  `codex/ar297-production-container-live-evidence`, based on `origin/main`
  `0a23983a`. Never use the shared checkout.
- Clean recovery `0f086498`, ledger `330e7182`, binds exact `c1cf1793`.
- Linux remains **NO-GO**. AR-297/#335 stay open. Tracker writes, push, PR,
  merge, tag, signing, publication, release, and hosted workflow actions are
  not authorized.

## completed-evidence

- Replacement mode-0600 config `ar297-litellm-a4e213d6b454ca90.yaml` has SHA
  `a4e213d6...97348`: strict/additive, all six Agency routes through
  authenticated LiteLLM aliases, Qwen generation with thinking disabled,
  Mistral critic/reranker/recruiter/free child judge, and 4,096-dimensional
  Qwen embedding. Direct Ollama and Jina are absent from active routes.
- Exact ledger `c1cf1793` build, strict Twine, and independent verifier exit 0.
  Mode-0644 wheel `8766b539...99d7` is 9,300,725 bytes; sdist
  `5dbd6edc...bf68a` is 25,642,963 bytes; manifest `a04282e6...adade`.
- Codex/Claude/Hermes/OpenClaw/dashboard image IDs are `c735534e...bd3f`,
  `93ab0881...acc3`, `e8819230...94ef`, `5355886a...ca94`, and
  `fc23a724...666f`; exact verification exits 0 at `2f9dadb5...a449`.
- AR-317 passes 158 focused tests. Six Mistral/Qwen aliases are healthy and the
  shared fallback remains `8e801fde...075f`; model snapshot `6a80b30a...be8df`.
  Child probe `5c9d6a27...800f4` uses 20,050 tokens at `n_ctx=32768` with
  `truncated=0`/fallbacks 0; embedding `fb1d9fc7...34a94` is 4,096-dimensional.
- Exact schema/load and six-deployment checks exit 0 at `fb8d3384...f680f`;
  all four adapter probes pass and CLI warnings describe only cold hosts.
- Earlier exact `1f32915d` named gates pass: 860 Python tests (three skips), 138
  dashboard tests, routing, and 161/161 decision mutations. Refresh all gates
  for the final exact candidate.

## exact-blocker

- Fresh `c1cf1793` absence passes at `7d08f8c1...c341`; one no-bypass install
  `04f8c2df...7ad` exits 1 after spawn once, wait once at 300 seconds, child
  exit 0, and `timed_out=false`. AR-320's wait repair is live-proven.
- Stable Mistral abstains twice at Store route `fcdf4396...9447`; Qwen 14B is
  ruled out by truncated prose `d34221cc...af9c` and wrong JSON `697d9cd9...1ac0`.
- AR-321 rejects Qwen 9B/30B, Dolphin 24B, Qwen 2B, and Ministral 14B. The last
  returns invalid objects at `84a4b980...b8d1`, then schema-valid two-card JSON
  at `aa8917b2...6cef`; deletion `f40895e6...d6ab` closes its aliases.
  Granite abstains twice; Qwen 2.5 chooses the wrong card at `35f1030d...5e8e`;
  Llama then chooses `ai-evaluation-engineer` at `e39a84bd...8274`; its alias
  is removed. Schema Mistral passes initial `76d2cd38...d1a0` but repair
  abstains `98ead20c...c791`; GPT-OSS is empty disabled/low; both are removed.
  Fresh Mistral alias `4527083a...1ff6` awaits an uncached repeat; repair fails closed.
- No later ordinary Codex, Claude, Hermes, or OpenClaw process has a current
  successful Agency-turn receipt on this source.
- Refresh the host install/dashboard and named repository gates for the exact
  candidate, then remove both old and new AR-297 proof containers.
- AR-299 through AR-317 tracker parity, hosted cross-OS artifacts, signing,
  push, PR, merge, tag, publication, release, and exhaustive workflow dispatch
  remain unauthorized.

## same-task-continuity

Exact artifacts: `~/.agency-runtime/release-artifacts/`
`dist-c1cf1793db1bc98589ca958a553c502a0126c637-linux-ar297`; config is
`~/.agency-runtime/configs/`
`ar297-litellm-a4e213d6b454ca90.yaml`. Current evidence is
`~/.agency-runtime/evidence/ar297-go-c1cf1793`; Codex container
`agency-ar297-codex-c1cf1793` remains running, and older labelled evidence
containers remain. AR-321 evidence is under `ar321-child-judge`; all await
final teardown. Secret-safe helper:
`/tmp/agency-runtime-ar297-evidence.pcLOZn/run_with_litellm_key.py`.

## next-bounded-work-package

After compaction, reread this capsule and `git status`, then resume at the first
unchecked line. Mark an item complete only with exact retained evidence.

1. [x] Rebuild and independently verify artifacts/images from the exact
   AR-320/LiteLLM checkpoint; `c1cf1793` is the candidate.
2. [ ] Through AR-321, repeat schema Mistral and promote only a repeatedly exact
   free LiteLLM alias, then prove fresh Codex canonical delivery,
   consumption, header, finalization, Store correlation, and attestation.
3. [ ] Build and prove separate clean exact Claude, native-UID Hermes, and
   OpenClaw systemd production-container installs.
4. [ ] Run later ordinary unattended Conveyor-equivalent processes for all four
   harnesses; retain native artifacts, Store correlations, and full workforce
   prompt visibility without treating definition presence as runtime delivery.
5. [ ] Install the exact candidate on this Linux host and prove the private
   authenticated dashboard plus the approved service-manager contract.
6. [ ] Run every named repository gate and record exact exits and hashes.
7. [ ] Update canonical issues/capsule and make the required local substantive
   and `docs(worklog):` ledger commits.
8. [ ] Resolve and remove every container labelled `AR-297`; retain teardown
   evidence and verify zero labelled survivors.
9. [ ] Issue the Linux-scoped GO/NO-GO and complete the persistent goal only
   when all required items above are truthfully closed.

## constraints

- Keep registration, loading, canary, delivery, Store correlation, and model
  prose distinct. Never expose or persist a secret.
- Do not configure/call Jina, overwrite foreign policy, use an activation
  bypass, or touch the shared checkout.
- Free local child-judge alias tests/download are approved; keep every Agency
  route behind LiteLLM. No tracker, push, PR, merge, tag, signing, publication,
  release, hosted workflow, or unrelated model/config choice is authorized.
